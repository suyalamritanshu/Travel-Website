                Old Manali is a charming, laid-back district known for its wooded
                mountain trails, apple orchards, and scenic spots by the Manaslu
                River. It’s dotted with quaint backpacker lodgings and bohemian cafes
                serving global fare, grilled trout, and pancake breakfasts, while
                souvenir shops sell hand-knitted woollens and dreamcatchers. Set amid
                a cedar forest, 16th-century Hadimba Devi Temple contains a cave
                shrine. Manali is named after the Sanātanī lawgiver Manu (see Manusmriti). The name Manali is regarded as the derivative of Manu-Alaya (transl. 'the abode of Manu').

                called Dhungiri Van Vihar at the foot of the Himālayas. The sanctuary
                is built over a huge rock jutting out of the ground which was

                Manu Temple is an old temple located at a distance of 3 km from the
                main market of Manali. The entire shrine of Manu Temple is dedicated
                to the Manu – the Indian Sage, who was acknowledged to be the creator
                of this world. In fact, some legends rely heavily on the fact that the
                present-day temple is the exact place where sage Manu would meditate
                regularly. Unlike other temples that stood with it, this temple was
                never built for the ones who carry their hearts on their sleeves. To
                make your way to the shrine, you need to trespass a narrow road, which
                in itself seems to be nothing less than a thrilling adventure. Yet,
                the adventure buffs will find this place to be a perfect blend of
                comfort and exploration.
